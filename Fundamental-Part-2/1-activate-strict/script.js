'use strict';

//The "use strict" directive is only recognized at the beginning of a script or a function.

//You can use strict mode in all your programs. It helps you to write cleaner code, like preventing you from using undeclared variables.

//Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript.
//Keywords reserved for future JavaScript versions can NOT be used as variable names in strict mode.
// These are:
            // 1.implements
            // 2.interface
            // 3.let
            // 4.package
            // 5.private
            // 6.protected
            // 7.public
            // 8.static
            // 9.yield



//example:

let public = 34;  // crome:script.js:24 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected strict mode reserved word
